## RMarkdown template for responses to peer-review comments <img src="https://github.com/pjbouchet/respondR/blob/main/hex/respondR-hex.png" height=200 align="right" class="logo"/>

This package provides an Rmarkdown template for writing clear, professional-looking and consistently formatted responses to peer-review comments on scientific papers.
 
### Rationale

Responding to comments on a manuscript is an essential yet sometimes daunting part of the peer-review process, particularly as clear and well-crafted responses are often tedious to formulate but can go a long way towards ensuring acceptance. `respondR` was designed to take away some of that strain by providing a user-friendly RMarkdown template that can produce professional-looking and consistently formatted response documents â€” encouraging authors to focus on content rather than style. 

In particular, `respondR` conforms to best practice rules for academic peer-reviewing [Noble (2017)](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005730), and facilitates the tasks of:

* Providing an overview of edits (Rule 1).
* Making the response self-contained (Rule 3).
* Using typography to assist reviewers and editors in navigating the response (Rule 6).
* Clearly identifying the changes made to the submitted draft (Rule 9).

### Installation

The package and associated template can be installed using the following command:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("pjbouchet/respondR")
```

### Getting started

After installation, follow these steps:

* (1) In RStudio, go to File > New File > R Markdown > From Template [Note: You may need to restart RStudio first.]
* (1) Select the `Response to Reviewers` template from the list and click OK. This will create an Rmd file, populated with a default template.
* (3) Save the file to disk.
* (4) Use the `create_doc()` function to initialise the Microsoft Word (.docx) template document. You can also knit the document (Knit > Knit to response). If the function is run within RStudio, the .docx will be saved in the same location as the file that is currently active within the GUI (which should be the Rmd file, in most cases). If not, the function will default to the current working directory. This behaviour can be overridden by specifying the path to a desired directory using the `destination` argument.

``` r
respondr::create_doc()
respondr::create_doc(destination = "~MyComputer/Documents/")
```

(6) Fill in the Microsoft Word table template (see [vignette]()).
(7) Knit the Rmd file.
(8) Say "Abracadabra!".

Further details on how to use the template are given in the package [vignette]()
